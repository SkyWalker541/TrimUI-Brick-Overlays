# TrimUI-Brick-Overlays

**Update Feb 5, 2026: Added STN and Pixel Pop Overlays for GBC**

***I highly recommend turning colorization OFF in retroarch settings for all of the STN and Pixel Pop overlays, for the most accurate representation of original hardware.***


***STN Overlays***

The STN overlays atempt to reacreate the GBC screen as best as I can without using a shader.

"The GBC (Game Boy Color) STN display is a Super-Twisted Nematic Liquid Crystal Display. It is a type of passive-matrix LCD technology that was commonly used in the late 1980s and 1990s for portable devices, including Nintendo handhelds, because it was affordable and energy-efficient." -WIKIPEDIA

***Pixel Pop Overlays*** 

The Pixel Pop overlays utilize the same appearance as the STN overlays, but with some modifications to really make the pixels pop.

These Overlays are made with NextUI in mind. Config (.cfg) files located is seperate folder for full retroarch use.
